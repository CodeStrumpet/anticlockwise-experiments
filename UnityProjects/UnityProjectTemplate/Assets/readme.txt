PLEASE BACKUP PROJECTS BEFORE UPDATING PLAYMAKER!!

Playmaker - Visual scripting for Unity

Realize your creative vision without knowing how to program!

NOTE: The Playmaker/Asset Store license is for a single user at a time. If multiple people use Playmaker, you need multiple licenses!

INSTALLATION:

To install PlayMaker import Gizmos, iTween, and PlayMaker folders from the unitypackage.
To see sample scenes, import the included PlayMakerSamples.unitypackage.

UPGRADE NOTES:

Obsolete Actions: 

After updating, you may get errors about obsolete actions in your saved projects. These actions still work, but it is recommended that you upgrade them to the suggested action. If you want to do this later, you can turn off the error check for obsolete actions in Preferences. Obsolete actions are also hidden by default in the Action Browser. You can toggle this setting in the Action Browser settings menu.

Updated Actions:

PlayMaker now gives clearer feedback on how it handles actions that have changed since the project was saved. After loading a project/scene, open the PlayMaker Console window to get more info. Most of the time actions are updated seamlessly, and any new parameters are given default values. However, occasionally an action is incompatible and you will need to edit it by hand. The Console window lets you find and fix these errors.

Thanks and have fun with Playmaker!
